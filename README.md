Heroku App Deployment Link

In the frontend design, there are five fruits with no pictures, but the names are there and the details of the fruits can be seen on click. 
The reason for no pictures for those specific fruits is that I used this link
https://passport-media.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/eng-intern-interview/fruit-images.json.
to render all the images of the fruits and those five fruits does not have pictures in the provided link.
